# BoostMode
This is part of a project to add a boost mode to my daughter's Powerwheels Dune Racer. The RED led is the pin you would hook to your relay that adds another 6v in series for a total of 18v. The idea of boost mode is to not burn out the motor by giving it cool down time. I take no responsibility for damage to your toys or kids
