# BoostMode
This is part of a project to add a boost mode to my daughter's Powerwheels Dune Racer.
An additional 6v will be added in series by a relay controlled by the pin BOOST_RELAY_PIN.
The idea of boost mode is to not burn out the motor by giving it cool down time.

## Running
Open the code in your Arduino IDE (or whatever you use for transfer) and upload.
